      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
        FRYLY is a shared workspace for families, friends, and small teams who want a single place to keep track of everyday life together.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">
        Instead of juggling separate apps for notes, to-dos, files, reminders, and expenses, each group in FRYLY gets its own organised set of sections that stay in sync for everyone.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
        The goal is a calm, structured space that feels friendly on both desktop and phones, without the overhead of heavy project-management tools.
      </p>
